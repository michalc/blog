<p>This post assumes some understanding of and familiarity with Haskell monads.</p>

<h3>The beauty</h3>

<p>There are a number of requirements in programs</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Combining IO actions, making the result of each available to later ones: <em>IO monad</em></li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Building up, or reading from, a peusdo-mutable state or configuration: <em>Reader, Writer, and State monads</em></li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Running a sequence of functions where the later are skipped if the previous doesn't return a meaningful result: <em>Maybe monad</em></li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Running a function over all possible combined values of a number of lists: <em>List monad</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The beautiful is that problems that at face value are completely different actually share a common structure. They can be decomposed into their domain-specific components, and <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> (bind) and <code class="inline">return</code>, where, although different for all of the above examples, adhere to certain laws. Once you are familiar with any given instance of <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> and <code class="inline">return</code>, then it's really quite amazing how much can be achieved, and communicated, with just a few lines of code.</p>

<h3>The horror</h3>

<p>The "once you are familiar with any given instance of <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code>" hints at the horror. The <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> and <code class="inline">return</code> functions are (terribly?) overloaded. Each of the monads use the same notation, but they can all do radically different things. To know what any <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> actually does, you have to infer its type from the surrounding code, and look to its definition. Similarly a do-block's behaviour depends radially on the definition of <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code>: and it might be even worse, because <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> isn't even present in the code.</p>

<p>Taking and modifying some examples from <a href="http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#readert">What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell</a>, we can see a use of the Maybe monad,

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn . show $ example

example :: Maybe Int
example = do
  a <- Just 3
  b <- Nothing
  return $ a + b
{{/highlight}}

<p>and an example of the Reader monad.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
import Control.Monad.Reader

data MyContext = MyContext
  { foo :: String
  , bar :: Int
  } deriving (Show)

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn . show $ runReader computation $ MyContext "hello" 1

computation :: Reader MyContext (Maybe String)
computation = do
  n <- asks bar
  x <- asks foo
  if n > 0
    then return (Just x)
    else return Nothing
{{/highlight}}

<p>The monadic values <code class="inline">example</code> and <code class="inline">compution</code> definitions have similarities: do notation, <-, and return. However, these similarities are misleading. Take for example <code class="inline">return</code> from the Maybe monad. Its definition is</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
return = Just
{{/highlight}}

<p>while the Reader monad's definition is</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
return a = Reader $ \_ -> a
{{/highlight}}

<p>Similarly, because of the different implementations of <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code>, line breaks in the do-notations result in different code. Hence how monads are sometimes described as <em>programmable semicolons</em>.</p>

<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of non-explicit behaviour going on. In code reviews, I often use the term "magical" if there is non-explicit behaviour, and I usually suggest it is to be avoided. Yes, <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> and <code class="inline">return</code> are likely to abide by the monad laws, and they certainly do in these examples, but I'm unsure if this is enough to understand what's going on.</p>

<p>As a parallel, Mike Acton, in his talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">data-oriented design</a>, suggests only using C++ operator overloading that is "super obvious", such as adding vectors. Uncle Bob also teaches us to be more explicit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.</p>
  <cite>Robert C. Martin</cite>

<p>There are reasonable arguments that monads in Haskell, by overloading <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> and <code class="inline">return</code>, break these guidlines. Of course, perhaps I will feel differently once I have been working with Haskell for longer. We will see!</p>
