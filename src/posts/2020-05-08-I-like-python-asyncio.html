<p>Python's asyncio gets a fair bit of bad press. Some of it I agree with, but there is one aspect I like about it: the API needed for a lot of common tasks is actually fairly small and clear.</p>

<p>Here's a small but fairly realistic program. It creates a pool of HTTP connections, and uses this to make two concurrent chains of requests.</p>

{{#highlight 'python'}}
import asyncio
import httpx

async def async_main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        task_1 = asyncio.create_task(make_http_requests(client, {'some': 'data'}))
        task_2 = asyncio.create_task(make_http_requests(client, {'more': 'data'}))
        await asyncio.gather(task_1, task_1)

async def make_http_requests(client, data):
    resp_1 = await client.post('https://postman-echo.com/post', data=data)
    resp_2 = await client.post('https://postman-echo.com/post', data=resp_1.json())

asyncio.run(async_main())

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p>A task is an asyncio thread of execution. Multiple tasks can run concurrently: typically when a task is waiting for some data to be sent/received on the network, other tasks can progress. This is in fact the whole point of asyncio.</p>

<p>In the above example, <code class="inline">asyncio.run</code> creates the first task, and during that task, each call to <code class="inline">asyncio.create_task</code> creates another task that runs concurrently.</p>

<h3>await my_function()</h3>

<p>If you see <code class="inline">await my_function()</code> it means two things:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> the current task will schedule <code class="inline">my_function</code> to run, and wait for it to finish;</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> in the meantime other tasks can progress, typically during network I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3>asyncio.gather</h3>

<p>To wait for multiple tasks to finish, pass them to <code class="inline">asyncio.gather</code>, and <code class="inline">await</code> the result.</p>

<h3>async def my_function():</h3>

<p>A function declared as <code class="inline">async</code> is very similar to a regular function, but just calling it won't do anything: it then needs to be scheduled. This is done by either <code class="inline">await</code>ing its result, or passing it to another function such as <code class="inline">create_task</code> that will schedule it for you.

<p>Some don't like having to write <code class="inline">async</code> and <code class="inline">await</code>, but in complex multi-task programs, I find it useful to be clear which functions allow other tasks to progress, and which don't.</p>

<h3>async with</h3>

<p><code class="inline">async with</code> is like a regular context manager's <code class="inline">with</code>, except that during entry and exit, other tasks may progress. It's commonly used to create and destroy pools of network connections, often a part of HTTP or database clients.</p>

<hr>

<p>That's it! There are more parts to the API, but for a lot of common use-cases, you don't need them.</p>
