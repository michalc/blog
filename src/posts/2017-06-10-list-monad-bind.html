<p>The word monad is can be seen as scary, but you don't particularly need to worry about what it means in the general case in order to use the implementations of <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> (bind). For example, the list monad, where <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> is defined as below.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
(>>=) :: [a] -> (a -> [a]) -> [a]
xs >>= k = join (fmap k xs)
{{/highlight}}

<p>When evaluating <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code>, each element of <code class="inline">xs</code> is passed to <code class="inline">k</code>, which returns a list, and then the lists from each invocation of <code class="inline">k</code> are concatanated back together for the final value. This means that <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> can be used as an alternative to <code class="inline">filter</code>, <code class="inline">map</code>, or be used for local transformations of the list, such as repeating each element.</p>

<h3>As a filter</h3>

<p>Often you would like to filter a list based on a predicate. This can be done with <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> as below.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
filtered = list >>= \x -> if predicate x then [x] else []
{{/highlight}}

<p>This is equivalent to the below use of <code class="inline">filter</code>.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
filtered = filter predicate list
{{/highlight}}

<h3>As a map</h3>

<p><code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> can also be used to map a function over the elements of a list, i.e. end up with a list of the same length, but each element has been passed through another function. An example of this is below.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
mapped = list >>= return . mapper
{{/highlight}}

<p>This is equivalent to just using <code class="inline">map</code>.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
mapped = map mapper list
{{/highlight}}

<h3>As a local transform</h3>

<p>The cases where <code class="inline">>&gt;&gt;=</code> shines are those that can't be achieved using a single higher-order function. For example, repeating each element twice in a list.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
repeated = list >>= \x -> [x, x]
{{/highlight}}

<h3>Should I use <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code>?</h3>

<p>My instinct is to use the least general code that solves the problem you're tackling, and solves it clearly. So while using <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;=</code> for when there isn't a single other function that can do the job is good, using it when <code class="inline">map</code> or <code class="inline">filter</code> would do, while interesting, I would probably avoid.</p>
