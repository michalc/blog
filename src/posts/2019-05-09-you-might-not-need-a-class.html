<p>When writing Python, sometimes you need to store/manipulate state. There are two typical options:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Plain data structures [dictionaries, lists, sets etc.], passed to functions which perform mutation.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Instances of classes, i.e. objects, with the state as members, mutated using instance methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there is a third way:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> A class-like function [I didn't come up with this term], with the state stored in a closure.</li>
</ul>

<p>A class-like function is a "constructor" that returns "public" functions that can manipulate its state.</p>

{{#highlight 'python'}}
def MyClass(...)  # Capitalised to make it clear it's a "constructor"

    state_1 = ...
    state_2 = ...

    def func_1():
        nonlocal state_1
        ...

    def func_2():
        nonlocal state_2
        ...

    def func_3():
        ...

   return func_1, func_2  # Typically, 1 to 2 funcs
{{/highlight}}

<p>Used as, for example</p>

{{#highlight 'python'}}
func_1, func_2 = MyClass(...)
{{/highlight}}

<p>Such class-like functions have a few nice properties.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> They are <em>less</em> flexible than classes. Yes: this is a nice property when dealing with state. You can't just define a few more methods, add @properties, override methods in a subclass etc. State is often seen a source of bugs, and sometimes it's better to really limit how it's mutated.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> To test it, you are strongly pushed to only test the public interface, i.e. the functions returned from the function, rather than private implemenation details.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> They encourage stronger separation of responsibilities between code that mutates state, and code that doesn't. I would be wary of too strongly touting benefits of "separation of responsibilities"; but separating stateful and non-stateful code, all-things-being-equal, is good.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> You can name the returned functions whatever you like, even "_" if not needed.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> <a href="http://tech.magnetic.com/2015/05/optimize-python-with-closures.html">There are cases when it's faster</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As examples, <a href="https://github.com/michalc/lowhaio">lowhaio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/michalc/aiodnsresolver">aiodnsresolver</a> both use class-like functions.</p>
