<p>If you have a number of async tasks to queue and run with limited concurrency, here's a small utility function, <code class="inline">queue</code>, to do that.</p>

{{#highlight 'javascript'}}
const queue = (concurrency) => {
    var running = 0;
    const tasks = [];

    return async (task) => {
        tasks.push(task);
        if (running >= concurrency) return;

        ++running;
        while (tasks.length) {
            try {
                await tasks.shift()();
            } catch(err) {
                console.error(err);
            }
        }
        --running;
    }
}
{{/highlight}}

<p>You enqueue each task by passing it to the function returned by <code class="inline">queue</code>.</p>

{{#highlight 'javascript'}}
// In this case, we have a files array, and an async upload function
const files = [...];
const upload = async (file) => {...};

// Create the queue with a concurrency limit
const concurrency = 4
const enqueue = queue(concurrency);

files.forEach((file) => {
    enqueue(async () => upload(file));
});
{{/highlight}}

<p>If there there is available concurrency, a task will run [almost] immediately. Otherwise, it will wait until enough tasks ahead of it have completed for it to run within the concurrency limit.</p>

<h3>Use case</h3>

<p>A use for this is part of a file uploader that allows arbitrary numbers of uploads. Although browsers limit the number of connections, they also limit how many requests are queued. For example, Chrome can throw <code class="inline">net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</code> if you attempt to queue too many. Instead, you can queue the uploads up front.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Can add tasks at any point after queue creation</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> No recursion</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> No polling</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Small API</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Small amount of code</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Leverages async/await syntax: no handling of promises or callbacks, either internally or in client code</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it!</p>
