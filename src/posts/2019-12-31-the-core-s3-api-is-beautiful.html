<p>One of the beautiful, and maybe even genius, things about the core S3 API: it's just an HTTP PUT to store an object, and an HTTP GET to fetch it. You need <a href="https://gist.github.com/michalc/ccb87856363a895fd1fadf52ab4cdcec">a few headers</a>, but that's it.</p>

<h4>Structure of an S3 PUT request</h4>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="block">PUT /key/of/the/object HTTP/1.1\r\n
host: my-example-bucket.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\r\n
authorization: ...\r\n
content-length: ...\r\n
x-amz-content-sha256: ...\r\n
x-amz-date: ...\r\n
The bytes of the object</code></pre></div>

<h4>Structure of an S3 GET request</h4>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="block">GET /key/of/the/object HTTP/1.1\r\n
host: my-example-bucket.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\r\n
authorization: ...\r\n
x-amz-content-sha256: ...\r\n
x-amz-date: ...\r\n</code></pre></div>

<p>This means that as long as you can inject the right headers, you can use <em>any</em> HTTP client to make the requests. Here's an example using Python requests.</p>

{{#highlight 'python'}}
import os
import requests

# from https://gist.github.com/michalc/ccb87856363a895fd1fadf52ab4cdcec
from aws_sig_v4_headers import aws_sig_v4_headers

host = 'my-example-bucket.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com'
service = 's3'
region = 'eu-west-1'
path = '/key/of/the/object'
pre_auth_headers = {}
query = {}
data = b''
headers = aws_sig_v4_headers(
	os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'], pre_auth_headers,
	service, region, host, 'GET', path, query, data,
)
response = requests.get(f'https://{host}{path}', headers=headers)
{{/highlight}}

<p>If the core wasn't so straightforward, I suspect S3 would not be anywhere near as popular, and S3-compatible storage providers may not even exist.</p>

<p>I don't often say this: but thank you AWS.</p>
