<p>Trying to understand functors, I came accross the initially strange fact that functions are functors. Which means, roughly speaking, you can "map", another function over it. So given a function</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
g :: r -> a
{{/highlight}}

<p>and another function</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
f :: a -> b
{{/highlight}}

<p>you can "map" the second function over the first to get another function, which is defined as the composition of the two.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
fmap f g :: r -> b
fmap f g = f . g
{{/highlight}}

<p>Similarly, and more familiarly, you can take a list</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
xs :: [a]
{{/highlight}}

<p>and a function</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
f :: a -> b
{{/highlight}}

<p>and map the function over the list to get another list.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
fmap f xs :: [b]
fmap f xs = [f x | x <- xs]
{{/highlight}}

<p>(I suspect this isn't how <code class="inline">fmap</code> is defined on a list in the real source, but I find list comprehensions quite easy to understand.)</p>

<p>The suprising thing is that you can express two seemingly very different activities, mapping a function over a list, and composing a function with another function, in Haskell using the same function: <code class="inline">fmap</code>. Here "the same" is defined as having the same type signature.</p>

{{#highlight 'haskell'}}
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
{{/highlight}}

<p>Although yes, the implementation of <code class="inline">fmap</code> for functions and lists are indeed different.</p>
