<p>This is a known bug <a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8873">bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8873</a>, but I couldn't find it on a search, so it might be helpful to post here.</p>
<p>I was creating a datepicker for a date of birth field, with no default value, and with a yearRange of "c-100:c-1". However, the year dropdown kept on jumping to 100 years before the actually selected year. I changed the yearRange option to "c-100:c" and it then worked fine.<p>
