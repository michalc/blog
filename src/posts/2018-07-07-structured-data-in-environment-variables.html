<p>I recently wrote a small Python application that had to be configurable so it can run differently in different environments. As is often done, I used environment variables for this.</p>

<p>However, for various reasons beyond the scope of this post, it was helpful to have <em>structured</em> data stored in the environment: lists, dictionaries, and even lists of dictionaries. So when the application runs, it should be able to extract this and get something that looks like:</p>

{{#highlight 'python'}}
config = {
    "FOO": [{
        "BAR": "setting-1",
        "BAZ": "setting-2",
    }, {
        "BAR": "setting-3",
        "QUE": "setting-4",
    }],
    "FIZZ": [
      "setting-5",
      "setting-6",
    ],
    "BILL": "setting-7",
}
{{/highlight}}

<p>This could be done by encoding such a structure into a single string, perhaps using JSON, throwing it into a single environment variable, and decoding it in the application. However, this would be fairly painful to edit and difficult to debug in many situations.</p>

<p>So I came up with a simple format where each setting is in its own variable, but its <en>name</em> defines where it is in the structure. Specifically each name is</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> a double-underscore separated list of path components;</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> and where each level of components defines a dictionary unless all of them parse as integers, in which case the level defines a list.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the above config could be defined in bash by:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="block">export FOO__1__BAR=setting-1
export FOO__2__BAZ=setting-2
export FOO__1__BAR=setting-3
export FOO__2__QUE=setting-4
export FIZZ__1=setting-5
export FIZZ__2=setting-6
export BILL=setting-7
</code></pre></div>

<p>and to convert this list of environment variables to nested Python dictionaries and lists, you can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/michalc/59efee4bde412d137367d44049df8924">normalise_environment.py</a>:</p>

{{#highlight 'python'}}
import os

config = normalise_environment(os.environ)
{{/highlight}}

<p>This way of incorporating structure into environment variables has some nice properties.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> The double underscore is likely to not cause issues because underscores are used in environment variables frequently.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> No (extra) escaping needed. You can set them easily on the command line, any old bash script, Travis, CircleCI, CloudFoundry, ECS task defintions.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> You can then <em>read</em> them really easily, which is good for debugging.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> If you don't currently use any double underscores in environment variable names, you can put your entire environment through <a href="https://gist.github.com/michalc/59efee4bde412d137367d44049df8924">normalise_environment.py</a>, and it will be unchanged. This helps in moving existing config to a more structured form in small steps.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Although the function <a href="https://gist.github.com/michalc/59efee4bde412d137367d44049df8924">normalise_environment.py</a> is helpful in Python, it's by no means necessary. Any code that can read environment variables can access their contents, without extra steps or dependencies involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to call this</h3>

<p>I'm not sure how best to refer to this technique (it's almost so trivial calling it a "technique" is a bit much...). It's not quite <em>flattened</em> since the structure is preserved. Storing the variables <em>denormalised</em> is the best I have, since it can be argued that the location of each variable in the structure is denormalised.</p>
