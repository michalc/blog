<p>This post contains the high level steps for the site architecture and deployment strategy for <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html">blue-green deployment</a> for a static site hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few things that are required for a reasonable blue-green strategy.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> No downtime between releases.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Atomic deployment. A visitor sees a whole working version from before or after the deployment. This can be tricky because a user doesn't request a site atomically, i.e. first the HTML is requested, and then some time later all the static resources.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> E2E tests run on a certification environment that has the bare minimum of changes between it and production.</li>
</ul>

<p>To acheive this, you can place the entire site behind an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">API Gateway</a>. Although the documentation and marketing material hints that it is only suitable for APIs to be consumed programatically, there is nothing stopping it being used for an API to be consumed by people, i.e. a site made up of HTML (and indirectly, CSS, JavaScript, images and fonts). A few features of API Gateway make this possible.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> API gateway has the concept of <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/stages.html">stages</a>, where you deploy and API to a stage, and then, later, atomically update another stage to that deployment.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> API gateway can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integrating-api-with-aws-services-s3.html">proxy requests to S3</a>, so the entire HTML of the site can placed behind the API gateway.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> API gateway supports <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html">custom domains</a> and the ability to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html#how-to-custom-domains-mapping-basePath-examples">map paths</a> to specific stages.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these features in mind, the overal architecture of the site can be as follows.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> You have all the HTML pages of the site defined as an API, with appropriate resources defined. A <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/create-api-using-import-export-api.html">Swagger definition file</a> is a reasonable choice for this.</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> 2 stages setup for the API, each with a custom domain. The public domain of the site has an API mapping from the root path to the production stage; and another domain, which is used for certification, has an API mapping from the root path to the certification stage.</li>
  	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> A single S3 bucket for the assets, i.e. everything except the HTML. These must have versioned file names, such as having a fragment of the md5 hash of the contents. This S3 bucket can be behind a Cloudfront distribution if you would like.<li>
  	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Two S3 buckets for the html. One for production and one for certification.</li>
</ul>

<p>A strategy to deploy using this is below.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Deploy static assets to the asset bucket, making sure that each is has a file name that is versioned with an MD5 of its contents, and existing assets are not deleted.</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Determine which bucket is in production. One choice is to actually embed this as a mock route in the Swagger definition file, and download this in the build script, so you have an up to date file.</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Upload all HTML to the bucket that isn't in production: the certification bucket.</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Modify the Swagger definition file so requests for HTML are proxied to the certification bucket. You could use your favourite template language for this.</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Deploy the API, as defined by the modified Swagger definition file, to the certification stage. Take note of the deploymentId.</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Run E2E tests.</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> If they all pass, update the production stage so its deploymentId is set to the certification stage.</li>
</ul>

<p>At every stage above, a visitor to the public site will fetch either the pre-release HTML, or the post-release HTML. In both cases, all the assets will load correctly.</p>

<p>Note: To keep this post brief, not part of this strategy is removal of assets that are no longer used.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>
